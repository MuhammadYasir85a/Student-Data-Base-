#Student Database Management System
This project demonstrates how data structures can efficiently solve real-world problems. The system uses hashing for fast and effective data management and retrieval.

Key Features:
1. Two Access Modes:

Admin Mode: Full access to manage student records (insert, delete, update, search).
Student Mode: Limited access to view relevant data.
2. Insert student records
3. Delete student records
4. Retrieve student data
5. Search for student information
6. Store data persistently
The application provides a user-friendly interface, developed using Qt for GUI implementation. Data storage is handled through CSV files, ensuring easy and efficient data management.

This project fulfills the fundamental requirements of a Student Database Management System while implementing role-based access control for better security and usability.
